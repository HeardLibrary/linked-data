## What's Linked Data?

Linked Data is a way to model data as a graph of interconnected resources.  Visually, you can imagine it as a collection of interconnected bubbles connected by arrows.  Each bubble represents a particular entity and the arrows represent the relationships between the entities.  The classic concept of Linked Data imagines a machine-readable analog of the web where data from many different sources can be discovered and combined to create a dataset that is greater than what could be assembled by any individual.  

There are many approaches to using Linked Data. Some of them, like [RDF](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-primer/), [JSON-LD](https://json-ld.org/), and the [SPARQL query language](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-overview/) are [W3C](https://www.w3.org/) standards.  Other tools like [neo4j](https://neo4j.com/) and its associated query language [Cypher](https://neo4j.com/developer/cypher-query-language/) are not part of any standard, but are also widely used.  The [Sementic Web]() is effectively an extension of Linked Data that allows computers to compute new knowledge by combining information from multiple sources.  Linked Data underpins the popular Wikidata data source and Linked Data can be used to commuincate more clearly to search engines the important details about a web page or site.

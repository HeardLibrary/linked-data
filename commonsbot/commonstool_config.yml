# Wikimedia Commons API login credentials
# -----------

# endpointUrl=https://commons.wikimedia.org
# username=User@bot
# password=465jli90dslhgoiuhsaoi9s0sj5ki3lo

# Username and password are for a bot that you've created.
# The file must be plain text. 

# The credentials_path value (below) specifies location of the Wikimedia login credentials file. It may be a simple 
# file name or may be an absolute or relative path. 
# You must take care to isolate that file from the code and configuration files if they are publicly 
# exposed (e.g. on GitHub). 
# Setting the credentials_path_relative_to_home_directory to true appends the value of credentials_path to the path 
# to the home directory as determined by the operating system. In that case, you should either provide a simple file 
# name if that file is placed in the home directory, or provide a path relative to the home directory (no leading slash), 
# ending in the file name. 
# If you want to specify an absolute path, set credentials_path_relative_to_home_directory to false and provide the
# full path to the file as the value of credentials_path. 
# Warning: If you set credentials_path_relative_to_home_directory to false, it is dangerous to set a path relative to
# the working directory since the working directory and its subdirectories may be exposed publicly if they are published.

# Non-critical edits to commons should be made no faster than once every 5 seconds. 
# See https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Bots#Bot_speed
# Therefore a waiting time of at least 5 seconds is enforced between file uploads to commons by the value of commons_sleep.

# IMPORTANT NOTE: If you hack this script to upload media to Commons, you MUST NOT decrease the delay time between
# Commons API uploads to less than 5 seconds in order to speed up writing. If you do, then your script isn't 
# BaskaufCommonsBot and you need to change the user_agent_string_template to use your own URL and email address.
# The same holds true if you make other substantive changes to the way that the script interacts with the API.
# This script attempts to respect the "good citizen" guidelines for using the API and you should too.

# Because the ASW IIIF s3 bucket upload of the media file is slow, more than 5 seconds may elapse before the next Commons
# file upload. If that occurrs, then no additional delay is added prior to the next Commons file upload. However, if you  
# do not use the IIIF server features of the script, or if the file is small and takes less than 5 seconds to upload, 
# the script will automatically sleep long enough to impose a total delay of the number of seconds given in the 
# commons_sleep setting.

# NOTE: upload rate limits for structured data in Commons are controlled by a different mechanism (maxlag). If the server is 
# lagged when uploading structured data, this may also cause more than 5 seconds to elapse and also eliminate the need for
# an additional delay before the next Commons media upload.
commons_sleep: 5

# Set the value of the maxlag parameter to back off when the Commons API server is lagged.
# This applies only to uploads to the structured data on Commons Wikibase instance.
# see https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Maxlag_parameter
# The recommended value is 5 seconds.
# To not use maxlang, set the value to 0
# To test the maxlag handler code, set maxlag to a very low number like .1
# If you don't know what you are doing, leave this value alone. In any case, it is rude to use a value greater than 5.
maxlag: 5

# If you change these values or significantly modify the software, you need to use your own user-agent string.
# %s will be replaced with the current script_version value from the script global variables.

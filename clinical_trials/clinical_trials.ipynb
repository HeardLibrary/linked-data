      "              \"BriefSummary\": \"The treatment regimen for type 1 diabetes is complex and demanding, and many adolescents have problems with adherence. The proposed study will pilot test a positive psychology intervention for adolescents with type 1 diabetes aimed at improving adherence to treatment based on feedback from the first iteration of the intervention. The potential benefits include helping adolescents achieve better glycemic control, thereby reducing the health risks and complications associated with diabetes.\",\n",
      "              \"DetailedDescription\": \"The proposed study has the potential to improve adherence to the diabetes regimen in adolescents with type 1 diabetes without compromising their quality of life. The potential benefits include helping adolescents achieve better glycemic control, thereby reducing the health risks and complications associated with diabetes.\\n\\nThe investigators will use a positive psychology framework, which emphasizes positive emotions and strengths rather than problems, to promote adherence.\\n\\nPositive affect, defined as feelings that reflect pleasurable engagement with the environment (e.g., happy, cheerful,proud), have been linked with favorable health outcomes and increased adherence to medical regimens. Further, positive affect has been shown to increase people's ability to use complex coping strategies. Randomized controlled trials of positive psychology interventions have been shown to successfully increase adults' adherence to medication and physical activity recommendations. However, no studies have examined the effects of positive psychology interventions on adherence behaviors in pediatric populations. Our ongoing work suggests that positive affect in adolescents with type 1 diabetes is related to greater use of adaptive coping strategies, lower levels of family conflict, and fewer depressive symptoms, and demonstrates that a positive psychology intervention has the potential to induce positive affect in adolescents. The investigators propose to pilot test a positive psychology intervention for adolescents with type 1 diabetes. This low-cost, innovative intervention is designed to induce positive affect in adolescents (age 13-17) through tailored exercises in gratitude and self-affirmation. The investigators will also promote positive parental involvement by asking caregivers to provide positive affirmation statements to adolescents. Finally, the investigators will explore the use of technology by delivering the intervention to adolescents and sending reminders to caregivers via text message using the Twilio/REDCap system.\\n\\nBlood glucose monitoring is one of the best indicators of adherence to the recommended treatment regimen for type 1 diabetes, and frequency of blood glucose monitoring is strongly related to glycemic control. Further, frequency of blood glucose monitoring has been shown to decrease with age in adolescents, and parental reminders to check blood glucose are often a source of conflict between adolescents and their parents. Therefore, blood glucose monitoring represents a specific behavior that may be the best target for adherence interventions in adolescents with type 1 diabetes.\\n\\nThus, the specific aims are as follows:\\n\\nAim 1: Adapt a positive psychology intervention for adolescents (age 13-17) with type 1 diabetes designed to increase the frequency of blood glucose monitoring. Aim 2: Evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of a positive psychology intervention for adolescents with type 1 diabetes and their caregivers delivered by text message with the Twilio/REDCap system. The primary outcome is glycemic control, and secondary outcomes include positive affect, coping, adherence (i.e., frequency of blood glucose monitoring), family conflict, and quality of life.\"\n",

The goal of the intervention is to safely deprescribe medications, as defined by dose reductions and stopped medications, based on a combination of clinical criteria and patient preferences. The investigators will evaluate the effects of the intervention on the total number of medications prescribed to patients at hospital and SNF discharge and at home 90-days after SNF discharge along with the prevalence of eight geriatric syndromes, medication adherence, and health status.\",\n",
      "              \"DetailedDescription\": \"This randomized, controlled trial will evaluate the effects of an intervention to reduce exposure to medications among hospitalized older adults discharged to skilled nursing facilities (SNFs). This study will be conducted in one university-affiliated hospital and 14 area SNFs to enroll approximately 1,300 total participants across five project years. Patients discharged to SNF represent the largest segment of Medicare beneficiaries discharged to post-acute care services and are a particularly high risk group for loss of independence and other poor clinical outcomes. This investigative team recently completed a Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Innovation Award, which provides strong preliminary data related to the prevalence of polypharmacy and the relationship between polypharmacy and geriatric syndromes (e.g., medications associated with falls) in this patient population. Based on these data, the investigators developed a structured deprescribing intervention protocol (\\\"Shed-Meds\\\") coupled with standardized screening assessments for eight geriatric syndromes to be implemented in the hospital and continued during the SNF stay. The goal of the intervention is to safely deprescribe medications, as defined by dose reductions and stopped medications, based on a combination of clinical criteria and patient preferences. This trial will evaluate the effects of this intervention on medication exposure, medication adherence, geriatric syndromes, and health status across the care transitions from hospital to SNF to home to include a 90-day follow-up period after SNF discharge. The overarching hypothesis is that reducing medications for older patients across the continuum of care will favorably impact geriatric syndromes.\"\n",

      "              \"BriefSummary\": \"There are no medical therapies indicated for reduction of limb ischemic events. Studies of dual-antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel versus aspirin alone (CASPAR) as well as studies of systemic anticoagulation (WAVE) have shown no benefit for either strategy in the reduction in limb vascular events. Surgical bypass grafting involves harvesting of the vein, warm ischemia with disruption of vaso vasorum, ischemia-reperfusion, and finally heightened hemodynamic stress in the new arterial environment. Vein grafts rapidly remodel in response to the increase in blood flow and pressure in an attempt to normalize them into physiological range. The investigators have previously identified 3 distinct temporal phases of the remodeling process: During the first 30 days following implantation is a critical period of luminal enlargement which appears to be an endothelium-independent process. The second phase occurs between 1 and 3 months and represents a period of stiffening of the vein graft indicating synthesis of fibrous proteins. The third period is referred to as biochemical remodeling wherein the vein recovers clinically measureable endothelial function. It is likely diabetes mellitus impacts each of these phases. TRA2\\u00b0P-TIMI 50 demonstrated a reduction in acute limb ischemic (ALI) events (42% reduction) and urgent peripheral arterial revascularizations (35% reduction), a finding unique among medical therapies. While the temporal trend in reduction in ALI events occurred early and late after exposure suggestion an antithrombotic mechanism, the reduction in elective revascularization occurred later suggested beneficial effects beyond platelet inhibition. The purpose of this trial is to study the physiological impact of vorapaxar on lower extremity bypass graft maturation and function.\",\n",
      "              \"DetailedDescription\": \"Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is characterized by atherosclerotic occlusive disease of the lower extremities. More than 8 million Americans and 200 million people globally have PAD. Recent data reveal a prevalence of 15% in the MEDICARE population. In populations at risk, patients with a history of diabetes or cigarette smoking, the risk may rise as high as 30%. In addition to the heightened risk of myocardial infarction and stroke, PAD increases the risk of lower extremity claudication and critical limb ischemia. Lower extremity bypass grafting is an important method of restoring blood flow to the distal limb, reducing symptoms of claudication, and preventing amputation in patients with severe PAD.\\n\\nVorapaxar is a protease activated receptor (PAR)-1 antagonist that inhibits thrombin activation of the PAR-1 receptor. Vorapaxar has been FDA approved for patients with PAD to reduce the rate of cardiovascular death, MI, stroke, and urgent coronary revascularization. It is prohibited in patients with a previous stroke. In addition, patients treated with vorapaxar were noted to have a significant reduction in the rates of acute limb ischemia. This study will be a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled randomized study of vorapaxar vs. placebo in 80 patients undergoing femoral-popliteal bypass grafting for Rutherford 3 - 5 disease.\\n\\nBaseline visit: Informed consent will be signed. Vital signs will be taken and blood drawn fasting for baseline values.\\n\\nFirst visit, pre-surgery: Blood will be drawn for platelet activation testing. A 6 minute walk test will be performed. Brachial artery reactivity testing will be performed. An ankle-brachial index will be performed.\\n\\n30 days: Platelet testing will be performed. 90 days: Limited history and physical exam. 180 days: Limited history and exam, blood draw for biomarkers, brachial artery reactivity testing. Vein bypass graft reactivity testing.\\n\\n360 days: 6 minute walk test and ankle brachial index will be performed.\\n\\nRandomization: The Investigational Pharmacy will create a block randomization. Patients in the active treatment group will receive vorapaxar 2.08 mg daily or matching placebo. Treatment will continue for 1 year.\\n\\nIn addition, 20 healthy subjects to serve as a control population to define normal parameters during a single visit day. The healthy subjects will not be administered vorapaxar or placebo.\"\n",

      "              \"DetailedDescription\": \"This research will determine whether insulin resistance (IR) in T1DM is predominantly an effect of chronic hyperglycemia, as is commonly accepted, or a consequence of iatrogenic hyperinsulinemia in the peripheral circulation, as alternatively hypothesized. IR is a consistent but under-recognized finding in T1DM. Despite its independent contribution to micro- and macrovascular disease, its underlying cause has not been established nor have strategies to mitigate it been developed. This research will also characterize IR in maturity onset diabetes of the young, type 2 (MODY2), a population for whom IR has been inadequately studied to date.\\n\\nInsulin therapy in T1DM attempts to achieve euglycemia but does so in an \\\"unphysiologic\\\" way, by delivering insulin into the subcutaneous tissue as compared to physiologic delivery directly into the hepatic portal circulation. Although life-saving, peripheral insulin delivery in T1DM results in a loss of the normal insulin distribution; the physiologic state maintains insulin at 3-fold higher concentrations in the portal circulation compared with the peripheral circulation. IR in T1DM could therefore occur in response to peripheral hyperinsulinemia, a mechanism that would protect against hypoglycemia and ensure adequate glucose delivery to the central nervous system.\\n\\nMODY2 is a condition that results a mutation in the gene encoding glucokinase (GCK), which in turn causes a defect in \\u03b2-cell sensitivity to glucose due to reduced glucose phosphorylation. This effectively raises the \\\"set point\\\" for insulin secretion in response to increased glycemia. Because MODY2 patients retain pancreatic insulin secretion, they usually require no insulin therapy and have a normal insulin distribution between the portal and peripheral circulations.\\n\\nWe therefore hypothesize that IR in T1DM 1) is a homeostatic response to increased peripheral insulin concentrations resulting from peripheral insulin delivery and not significantly attributable to hyperglycemia and 2) results primarily from peripheral tissue IR (especially muscle) and not primarily from hepatic IR. Further, we anticipate that patients with MODY2, a population that has hyperglycemia without hyperinsulinemia, will have insulin sensitivity similar to that of otherwise healthy, nondiabetic individuals.\\n\\nTo test this hypothesis, the hyperinsulinemic, euglycemic clamp will be used to assess IR in a cross-sectional study of 3 groups of subjects:\\n\\nnon-diabetic control subjects,\\npatients with well controlled T1DM, and\\npatients with MODY2\\n\\nKey metabolic differences between these 3 groups will enable us to parse out the relative contributions of peripheral hyperinsulinemia vs. hyperglycemia to IR in T1DM and MODY2. Further, the proposed research will provide information on whether novel therapeutic strategies to restore the normal portal to peripheral insulin distribution can normalize insulin sensitivity (e.g. hepatopreferential insulin analogs, intraperitoneal insulin delivery).\"\n",

Our previous work (NS49096) demonstrated that school-age children with NF+RD can respond to standard phonologically-based reading tutoring originally developed to treat reading disability in the general population. Combining our work with that by other researchers suggesting that a medication (Lovastatin) may counteract the effects of the deficient neurofibromin, and possibly ameliorate learning disabilities in NF1, the investigator propose to examine the synergistic effects of medication plus reading tutoring.\",\n",
      "              \"DetailedDescription\": \"Neurofibromitosis Type 1 (NF1) is a common autosomal dominant neurocutaneous syndrome. The most common concern of NF1 is learning disabilities (LDs). Approximately half of children with NF1 have LDs, the most common of which are reading disabilities (RDs).The purpose of this research is to gain a deeper understanding of the characteristics and treatment of RDs in NF1.\\n\\nThe Investigator will evaluate four different groups (see list below) to determine if there are differential outcomes in these groups of children with NF+RD. The first two groups will consist of NF1 patients, and the second two groups will consist of participants with RDs but without NF1.\\n\\nReading tutoring program and a medication called Lovastatin (NF1 patients)\\nReading tutoring program and no Lovastatin (placebo) (NF1 patients)\\nReading tutoring program (RD participants)\\nOther Academic \\\"Sham\\\" tutoring (eligible to receive reading tutoring after study participation is complete) (RD participants)\"\n",

If the patient is unable to swallow the capsule, enrollment in the study may deferred or declined.\\n\\nA child will be excluded if he/she meets any of the following criteria, which will be determined by initial telephone screening as well as review of medical/developmental history prior to and during testing:\\n\\nChild 7 years of age or less;\\nknown uncorrectable visual impairment;\\ndocumented hearing impairment greater than or equal to a 25 dB loss;\\nmedical contraindication to MRI procedures (e.g., metal devices);\\nany psychiatric, behavioral, or developmental disorder that would preclude active participation in in-depth tutoring sessions\\nPregnant at time of screening.\\n\\nKnown conditions which are contraindicated to Lovastatin\\n\\nHypersensitivity to the medication\\nUncontrolled Epilepsy\\nMetabolic Syndrome X, High Blood Sugar,\\nMuscle Damage Due to Autoimmunity\\nStroke caused by Bleeding in the Brain, Loss of Memory,\\nSeverely Low Blood Pressure\\nLiver Problems including Abnormal Liver Function Tests\\nSevere Renal Impairment,\\nSerious Muscle Damage that may Lead to Kidney Failure,\\nRecent Operation or significant Injury\\nMuscle Pain or Tenderness with Increase Creatinine Kinase,\\nHabit of Drinking Too Much Alcohol\\nPregnant or lactating. - Lovastatin is contraindicated during pregnancy and in nursing mothers because it decreases synthesis of cholesterol and other products of the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway that are essential components for fetal development.\\n\\nChildren who meet criteria for ADHD, Oppositional Defiant Disorder, adjustment disorder, and/or mild depression will be eligible as long as they are not taking psychotropic medications, with the exception of stimulant medication for ADHD.\\n\\nFor pilot participants only:\\n\\nCriteria for inclusion/exclusion for pilot participants is outlined below. Children who meet criteria for ADHD, Oppositional Defiant Disorder, adjustment disorder, and/or mild depression will be eligible as long as they are not taking psychotropic medications, with the exception of stimulant medication for ADHD.\\n\\nChildren ages 8-17\\nParticipant is a native English speaker\\nParticipant must either answer \\\"yes\\\" to question A, or answer \\\"yes\\\" to at least 2 items for questions 2-4 listed below:\\n\\nA. Has your child ever been diagnosed with a reading disability? B. Did your child have trouble learning how to \\\"sound out\\\" words? C. Have you (parent) ever been concerned about your child's reading ability? D. Did the school or teacher ever express any concerns about your child's reading ability?\\n\\nA child will be excluded if he/she meets any of the following criteria, which will be determined by initial telephone screening as well as review of medical/developmental history prior to and during testing:\\n\\nChildren 7 years of age or younger\\nprevious diagnosis of Intellectual Disability;\\nknown uncorrectable visual impairment;\\ndocumented hearing impairment greater than or equal to a 25 dB loss;\\nmedical contraindication to MRI procedures (e.g., metal devices);\\nknown IQ below 70;\\na pervasive developmental disorder; and\\nany known neurologic pathology, including epilepsy, spina bifida, cerebral palsy, traumatic brain injury, optic gliomas, and brain tumors (other than UBOs).\\nComorbid severe psychiatric disorders will also be excluded.\",\n",

# Attempts to provide structured data to Google  2018-09-25

To create structured data for [a blog post](http://baskauf.blogspot.com/2017/07/how-and-why-we-set-up-sparql-endpoint.html), I used the [Structured Data Testing Tool](https://search.google.com/structured-data/testing-tool), entered from the [Article Feature Guide](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/data-types/article) by the "See Markup" button.  I hacked the existing code to this:

```
<script type="application/ld+json">
{
  "@context": "http://schema.org",
  "@type": "BlogPosting",
  "mainEntityOfPage": {
    "@type": "WebPage",
    "@id": "http://baskauf.blogspot.com/2017/07/how-and-why-we-set-up-sparql-endpoint.html"
  },
  "headline": "How (and why) we set up a SPARQL endpoint",
  "image": {
    "@type": "ImageObject",
    "url": "https://2.bp.blogspot.com/--QLRvc44Ojk/WVlchjm06yI/AAAAAAAABek/bjWUfZ6HSYklqIYgYf21qEjTJtSLhwCowCLcBGAs/s640/application.png",
    "height": 640,
    "width": 524
  },
  "datePublished": "2017-07-02T15:11:00-07:00",
  "dateModified": "2017-07-02T15:11:00-07:00",
  "author": {
    "@type": "Person",
    "name": "Steve Baskauf",
    "@id":"https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4365-3135",
    "sameAs": "http://bioimages.vanderbilt.edu/contact/baskauf"
  },
  "publisher": {
    "@type": "Organization",
    "name": "Baskauf personal blog",
    "logo": {
      "@type": "ImageObject",
      "url": "https://scontent-atl3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/94f43ab4c94ca56c3d74f3d275fb7670/5C2E73A3/t51.2885-19/s150x150/13774778_1753029844967575_204181086_a.jpg",
      "width": 60,
      "height": 60
    }
  },
  "description": "This article describes the reasons why a working group at Vanderbilt University wanted to set up a SPARQL endpoint and provides the technical details necessary to do so."
}
</script>
```

Here are some notes:

1. I got the image URL for the post by right-clicking on the featured image, opening it in a new tab, then copying the URL.  I got the height and width (on a Mac) by downloading the image, right clicking on it in Finder, and selecting "Get Info".
2. I got the datePublished from the blog editing screen and used the same date for dateModified.  
3. I wanted Google to know who I was, so I added the @id key:value pair for my ORCID ID.
4. I also added a "sameAs" property to my contact page on Bioimages because I am going to describe my self there using structured data.
5. The publisher field would not allow the publisher to be a Person. So I made up an organization name.  It required a logo, so I found one that I used on Instagram and got its URL as I did for the featured image.
6. The testing tool complained when the logo width and height were 150x150 pixels, so I said they sere 60x60 (apparently the maximum allowed height), even though that's wrong.  Probably I should find a smaller logo.

## Inserting the JSON-LD into the blog post (Blogger platform)

To get the JSON-LD into the post, I edited the post.  Then I clicked on the HTML tab to switch from the WYSIWYG editor to HTML editing.  The editor just shows the body - I think it generates the head section later.  I pasted the JSON-LD (including the script container element) at the top of the editing screen.  It looked like this:

I saved the edited version, reloade the log page, then viewed the page source.  After scrolling about 600 lines down, into the body section, I found the JSON-LD:

That's good - Blogger didn't strip out the script tag!

Then I went to the [Google Structured Data Testion Tool](https://search.google.com/structured-data/testing-tool), entered the blog URL into the "Fetch URL" box, then clicked "Run test":

![](structured-data-test.png)

There were two sources of structured data.  The data provided by Blogger itself had 7 errors and 4 warnings.  My structured JSON-LD had 0 errors and 0 warnings (yea!).  Hopefully the bad structured data provided by Blogger won't cause me to be dinged by Google.

## Test to see if search results improve

In order to find out if the structured data helps, I wanted to get before and after Google search results.  So I googled "setting up a SPARQL endpoint".  Surprisingly, my blog post was the first hit, even on browsers where I wasn't logged in to Google and it didn't know my search history.  So I guess this isn't a good test to improve the search rank.  Here's what the results looked like:

If it changes to something better, I'll add another screenshot later.

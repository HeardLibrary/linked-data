# Munging data from Wikidata

| file | description |
|------|-------------|
| wikidata-to-turtle.sparql | SPARQL query to pull data about Vanderbilt people from Wikidata (including ORCID if there) |
| wikidata-student.ttl | query results for Vanderbilt people who were students at Vanderbilt |
| wikidata-employee.ttl | query results for Vanderbilt people who were employees of Vanderbilt |

This was an attempt to identify people in Wikidata who were identified as affiliated with Vanderbilt and to match them with ORCIDs.  However, few people had ORCIDs listed, so there was little overlap at the time when this was done (in 2017).

# Publications and authors metadata

This directory contains work related to harvesting information about authors and their publications.  

The author part of the project is related to author disambiguation and association with identifiers.  The `orcid` directory has most of this work, with some info in the `wikidata` directory.

The publications part is related to assembling publication metadata and identifiers (DOIs, Handles, Wikidata, etc.) and associating those publicaitons with their authors. The `crossref` directory has some work on this.

The `work-person-figure.png` and powerpoint file is an RDF model to represent institutions (Vanderbilt), people, and their works.

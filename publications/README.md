# Publications and authors metadata

This directory contains work related to harvesting information about authors and their publications.  

## VanderBot

See [this repository](../vanderbot/) for current information about Vanderbot. The VanderBot code in this repository is no longer maintained and is out of date.

## Other stuff

The publications part is related to assembling publication metadata and identifiers (DOIs, Handles, Wikidata, etc.) and associating those publicaitons with their authors. The `crossref` directory has some work on this.

The `work-person-figure.png` and powerpoint file is an RDF model to represent institutions (Vanderbilt), people, and their works.

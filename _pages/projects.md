This semester we centered our sessions around the book ["Learning SPARQL" by Bob DuCharme](http://www.learningsparql.com/).  Some random notes and PowerPoints are [here](https://github.com/HeardLibrary/semantic-web/tree/master/learning-sparql).

### Spring 2016. The Semantic Web

<img src="assets/owl-example.png" alt = "OWL example" /><br/>

We learned about the Semantic Web by working through the book ["Semantic Web for the Working Ontologist" by Allemang and Hendler](http://workingontologist.org/).  Some random notes and PowerPoints are [here](https://github.com/HeardLibrary/semantic-web/tree/master/sw-4-working-ontologist). We also played around with the Stardog graph database and SPARQL endpoint.

One of our projects this semester was to look at how data in several spreadsheets could be turned into Linked Data, then used to create an interactive web page built on queries of the data.

Read a [blog post](http://baskauf.blogspot.com/2016/11/sparql-based-web-app-to-find-chinese.html) about the project.

Play with a [web page built on the data](http://bioimages.vanderbilt.edu/http://bioimages.vanderbilt.edu/building-map.html).

Play with the [raw data and graph model](https://github.com/HeardLibrary/semantic-web/blob/master/sparql/tcadrt.md) at our [SPARQL endpoint](https://sparql.vanderbilt.edu/).

### Spring 2017. Modeling a cultural heritage dataset: Music and Vase-painting (and we set up a SPARQL endpoint!)

[Links to notes](https://github.com/HeardLibrary/semantic-web/blob/master/vase/README.md) from the semester.

[Notes](https://github.com/kopolzin/vuswwg-web-server) about how we set up the web server that hosts the SPARQL endpoint.

Visit the [SPARQL endpoint](https://sparql.vanderbilt.edu/) and [view its user guide](https://github.com/HeardLibrary/semantic-web/blob/master/sparql/README.md).

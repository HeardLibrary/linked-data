### Music in South Italian Vase-Painting Database
The database is a resource for studying music, musicians, and the iconography of performance in South Italian vase-painting of the 4th century BCE. It is built on rich descriptive information (metadata) about c. 2,500 vases with musical iconography and will be expanded to include other archaeological and iconographic evidence for South Italian musical performance. In Spring 2017, a sample dataset of c. 1,600 Apulian vases with musical iconography was converted into RDF to explore the potential of linked open data for large-scale iconographic studies. An interactive map of the last known location of the vases in the dataset is currently under development.

### Network Analysis of Trendall's Lists
In collaboration with [Bobby Smiley](https://bobbysmiley.com/), I am using [Gephi](https://gephi.org/) to create network visualizations of A.D. Trendall's lists of South Italian vase-painters to explore iconographic and stylistic patterns, particularly in the works of the mid-4th century BCE Darius and Underworld Painters and their associates. The preliminary results of this project were presented at [HASTAC 2017](http://hastac2017.org/).

### Digital Approaches to Recontextualizing Museum Artefacts
As the instructor of a Spring 2018 seminar in the Vanderbilt University History of Art department, I am investigating how 3D printing, network visualizations, augmented and virtual reality, and other digital tools can facilitate recontextualization of archaeological artefacts for museum visitors. Students are using photogrammetry software [Agisoft PhotoScan](http://www.agisoft.com/) to create 3D models of ancient Greek and Roman artefacts in the Vanderbilt Art Gallery's collection and will present their research in a Gallery exhibit opening in October 2018. The [Scalar](https://scalar.me/anvc/) book forthcoming.

### 3D Lamps of Kenchreai
After a preliminary site visit in summer 2017 (at the invitation of Joseph L. Rife, co-director of the American Excavations at Kenchreai), I have composed a proposal for integrating 3D scanning, modelling, and printing into the research program and teaching curriculum of the field school. Upon approval, a selection of 3D-scanned objects would be recontextualized in digital models of the site created based on the data in the [Kenchreai Archaeological Archive](http://kenchreai.org/kaa), facilitating reinterpretation of a long-excavated and historically-pivotal site.

### 3D/VR Creation and Curation
In March 2018, three CLIR colleagues (Kristy Golubiewski-Davis, Jennifer Grayburn, and Zack Lischer-Katz) and I hosted a [two-day colloquium](http://vrpreservation.oucreate.com/Colloquium/) at the University of Oklahoma Libraries to discuss the creation and curation of 3D and VR digital objects. The CLIR report will be published in late 2018.

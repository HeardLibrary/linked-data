In 2016, I completed my PhD in Mediterranean Art and Archaeology at the University of Virginia with a dissertation entitled [_Sight and Sound: Music in 4th century BCE Apulian Vase-Painting_](http://dx.doi.org/10.18130/V3RG67). As the [CLIR Postdoctoral Fellow](https://www.clir.org/fellowships/postdoc/) at Vanderbilt University, I curate legacy datasets, collaborate on digital humanities projects, and cogitate on best practices for working with archaeological and art historical collections as data. In addition, I am the lab director and ceramicist for the San Giuliano Archaeological Research Project ([SGARP](http://www.baylor.edu/bic/index.php?id=940301)).

Head to [Research](../research) to learn more about my work, [Teaching](../teaching) for an introduction to my teaching philosophy, [In Development](../dev) to read about my ongoing digital projects, and [CV](../cv) for, well, my curriculum vitae.
